# -Control-of-Non-Linear-Process-using-Advanced-PLC-based-Control-System
MATLAB-based simulation of a nonlinear industrial process using PLC control concepts. Implements closed-loop PID control to reduce steady-state error and stabilize system response. Analyzes sensor feedback, setpoint tracking, and actuator behavior to demonstrate PLC-based automation and PID tuning for nonlinear systems.
